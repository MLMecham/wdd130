                <h1 id="title">Welcome to Art Camp!</h1>
                <div id="introduction">
                    <p>This art camp is specially designed for children who adore art and are keen on acquiring new skills while having a blast. Over the course of the week, youngsters will delve into straightforward art techniques and revel in crafting art projects and various crafts. Hello, I'm Brooklyn Mecham, and I'm absolutely thrilled to lead this camp. I have a genuine passion for art and am excited to share this enthusiasm with children, creating delightful art projects together. Throughout our time together, we'll explore different paints like watercolor, acrylics, and markers, and embark on projects such as print making, paint blowing, drawing, and much more!</p>
                    <p>This year marks the second edition of our art camp, and I'm delighted to announce that we've enhanced all our activities. With technology advancing rapidly, I'm thrilled to introduce a new and exciting skill to everyone: 3D printing. While this activity is a bit more advanced, it's tailored for older participants. The specifics are still in development, and I'd like to hear from you parents if your children would be interested in creating their own 3D printed art. The possibilities for this art form are endless. Depending on the level of interest shown, we'll determine the extent of its inclusion in the camp activities. But before that, we have an important question:</p>

                <h1>Why Should Your Child Participate in Art Camp?</h1>
                <div id="reasons">

                    <p id="reason1">1. Creativity Enhancement: Art camps provide a nurturing environment where children can explore their creativity freely. Engaging in various art activities such as painting, drawing, sculpting, and crafting can help your child unleash their imagination and develop their artistic skills.</p>
                    <p id="reason2">2. Confidence Building: Through art, children learn to express themselves in unique ways. As they see their ideas come to life on paper or in sculptures, they gain confidence in their abilities. This newfound confidence can extend beyond art into other aspects of their lives, such as academics and social interactions.</p>
                    <p id="reason3">3. Problem-Solving Skills: Art involves making decisions, experimenting with different techniques, and adapting to unexpected outcomes. By navigating these challenges, your child will sharpen their problem-solving skills and learn to think creatively to overcome obstacles.</p>
