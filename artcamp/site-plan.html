        What is Art Camp?

        This art camp is specially designed for children who adore art and are keen on acquiring new skills while having a blast. Over the course of the week, youngsters will delve into straightforward art techniques and revel in crafting art projects and various crafts. Hello, I'm Brooklyn Mecham, and I'm absolutely thrilled to lead this camp. I have a genuine passion for art and am excited to share this enthusiasm with children, creating delightful art projects together. Throughout our time together, we'll explore different paints like watercolor, acrylics, and markers, and embark on projects such as print making, paint blowing, drawing, and much more!

        This year marks the second edition of our art camp, and I'm delighted to announce that we've enhanced all our activities. With technology advancing rapidly, I'm thrilled to introduce a new and exciting skill to everyone: 3D printing. While this activity is a bit more advanced, it's tailored for older participants. The specifics are still in development, and I'd like to hear from you parents if your children would be interested in creating their own 3D printed art. The possibilities for this art form are endless. Depending on the level of interest shown, we'll determine the extent of its inclusion in the camp activities. But before that, we have an important question:     

        Why should your child participate in art camp?


        1. 
        Creativity Enhancement: Art camps provide a nurturing environment where children can explore their creativity freely. Engaging in various art activities such as painting, drawing, sculpting, and crafting can help your child unleash their imagination and develop their artistic skills.


        2.
        Confidence Building: Through art, children learn to express themselves in unique ways. As they see their ideas come to life on paper or in sculptures, they gain confidence in their abilities. This newfound confidence can extend beyond art into other aspects of their lives, such as academics and social interactions


        3.
        Problem-Solving Skills: Art involves making decisions, experimenting with different techniques, and adapting to unexpected outcomes. By navigating these challenges, your child will sharpen their problem-solving skills and learn to think creatively to overcome obstacles.


        4.
        Emotional Expression: Art provides a safe outlet for children to express their emotions and feelings. It allows them to communicate thoughts that might be difficult to express verbally. Art camp can teach your child healthy ways to cope with and process their emotions, fostering emotional intelligence.
        
        Now That sounds like a good idea! Below are two links, one to learn more the specific details about the art camp, ie the date and activities, and the other will show you a little more who I am!

      <h3>More about Brooklyn</h3>
      <p>
        Allow me to introduce myself; I'm Brooklyn Mecham, a seventeen-year-old Junior from Utah, born and raised alongside my large family of eight. From the earliest days of my childhood, I've been captivated by the world of drawing. What began as simple doodles of my parents and sketches of our beloved family dog has evolved into far more sophisticated projects, as evidenced by the artwork showcased below.

        "Lemon Curd Blueberry Wedding Cake"
        This was a lemon curd blueberry wedding cake I made for my sister’s wedding. My sister requested a naked style cake, decorated with baby's breath flowers. 

        Golden Still Life"
        This was a still life drawing I did for a daily drawing challenge. I focused on digitally painting gold items.

        "Self Portrait: Unveiling the Unspoken"
        This was a self portrait I made for my AP Art Portfolio class made with gouache and colored pencils. The meaning behind this piece was to not expect others to know what you are thinking.

        "Imaginary Adventures"
        This was another AP Art Portfolio project I made for class depicting my nephew on a roller coaster riding through his imagination. It was inspired by  Bear World.
        “A Digital Delight”
        This was a digital drawing practice I did of a gooey pizza box.

        "Sculpted Animal Keychains”
        These were some 3D sculpted animal keychains I'm working on. I plan to 3d print them, paint them, and sell them.

        I hope you've enjoyed perusing some of my artwork, and it's worth noting that all of the pieces showcased were created within the past year alone. For me, art isn't just about mastering drawing techniques; it's a multifaceted journey that influences various aspects of life. Reflecting on my own experiences, I realize that art has profoundly shaped my identity and outlook. I can't imagine how different I would be without the ability to express myself through art as I do now. This is precisely why I'm so passionate about organizing these camps—to share the immense joy and fulfillment that art has brought to my life with you and your families. It's my hope that through these experiences, we can inspire creativity, foster self-expression, and create lasting memories together.

      <h3>Schedules and Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        Join us for an exciting week of creativity and fun at our art camp, taking place from June 10th to the 14th in American Fork, conveniently located near Costco. The exact location will be disclosed to those who register, ensuring privacy and security for all participants.
        To ensure the best experience for our young artists, we've organized two separate age groups: ages 3-5 and 6-10.
        For our younger artists (ages 3-5), our sessions will run from 9:30 to 11:00 AM. We'll focus on exploring colors and shapes, drawing inspiration from beloved storybooks. Through engaging activities in painting, drawing, and printmaking, we'll delve into the vibrant world of the color wheel and much more!
        For our older group (ages 6-10), sessions will be held from 11:15 AM to 12:45 PM. We'll sharpen our drawing and shading skills with guided art lessons, emphasizing how shapes serve as the foundation for captivating artwork. From learning painting techniques to bringing favorite characters to life on paper, we'll embark on a journey of artistic discovery through paints, printmaking, and beyond.
        At the end of our enriching week, we'll celebrate the creativity and hard work of our young artists with a final art show on Friday. Families and friends are invited to join us as we showcase the masterpieces created throughout the week.
        The cost for the entire week is $50, or participants may opt for a daily rate of just $10 for those who can only attend certain days. For flexibility, please reach out to us if you're unable to join us for all five days, and we'll adjust accordingly. Payments can be made via Venmo or cash (Venmo: @Andrew-Leo-Mecham-1).
        We're eagerly anticipating this enriching and enjoyable experience, where creativity knows no bounds. Join us as we unleash imaginations and create lasting memories together!

        This time the margins are part of the page, but will be a different color. I did this to try and maintain the elements in the middle the same size 
        no matter how big the screen may get. I image it will look like google docs with one color in the middle and a litter version of that color on the 
        outside. Another note is that all text-boxes will match the color of the background color and won't have borders. This is to make the text free 
        standing and avoid the text looking cramped. The text is the same text that will be in the website and the images have all been assinged spots with
        their names marking them.

        I know that this image does not show the header and footer, but I promise that it was made. The issue was that it was too large to include everthing
        so I just include the main section and it barely fit. I know it says "ut" and not "out". I fixed it on the wireframe itself, but I didn't get another 
        screenshot as this one was so large it was difficult.
