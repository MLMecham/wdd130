            <p>To ensure the best experience for our young artists, we've organized two separate age groups: ages 3-5 and 6-10.</p>

                <img src="images/oldcamp.jpg" alt="Calendar for the older children">
                <p>For our younger artists (ages 3-5), our sessions will run from 9:30 to 11:00 AM. We'll focus on exploring colors and shapes, drawing inspiration from beloved storybooks. Through engaging activities in painting, drawing, and printmaking, we'll delve into the vibrant world of the color wheel and much more!</p>
                <p>For our older group (ages 6-10), sessions will be held from 11:15 AM to 12:45 PM. We'll sharpen our drawing and shading skills with guided art lessons, emphasizing how shapes serve as the foundation for captivating artwork. From learning painting techniques to bringing favorite characters to life on paper, we'll embark on a journey of artistic discovery through paints, printmaking, and beyond.</p>
